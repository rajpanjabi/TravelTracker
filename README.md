Family Travel Tracker


Project Description
This project, named "Travel Tracker," is a web application built with Node.js and Express, and it interfaces with a PostgreSQL database. It allows users to track the countries they have visited. The application features a simple user interface where users can add a country to their visited list. Once a country is added, it is stored in the PostgreSQL database.

The front-end is rendered using EJS templating and includes an interactive map where visited countries are highlighted. Users interact with the application through a form to add countries, and the total number of visited countries is displayed.
